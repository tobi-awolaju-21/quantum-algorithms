# quantum-algorithms
This repo has multiple projects implementing quantum algorithms using Qiskit, including Shor's for factoring integers, Grover's for searching databases, and more. Each project has its own directory, code, and docs to showcase my quantum software dev skills and provide a reference for others. Explore and enjoy!
